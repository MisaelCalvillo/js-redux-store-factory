# Vanilla Javascript Redux Store Factory

This repo is intended to make a Redux Store Factory just with plain vanilla Javascript.

### Create a Store

The first step is to create a Factory that encapsulates the state and a way to get it. 

```javascript

function createStore() {

  let state

  const getState = () => state

  return {
    getState
  }
}

const store = createStore();

```
